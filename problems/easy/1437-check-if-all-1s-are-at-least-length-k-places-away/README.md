**Acceptance Rate:** 59.3%

## Problem Description

Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
- `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
