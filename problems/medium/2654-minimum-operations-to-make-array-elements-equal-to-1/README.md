**Acceptance Rate:** 36.9%

## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers. You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Select an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and replace either of `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` with their gcd value.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of* `nums` *equal to* `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,6,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[2] with gcd(3,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,6,1,4].
- Choose index i = 1 and replace nums[1] with gcd(6,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 0 and replace nums[0] with gcd(2,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[3] with gcd(1,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,1].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,10,6,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make all the elements equal to 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

### Hints:
1. Note that if you have at least one occurrence of 1 in the array, then you can make all the other elements equal to 1 with one operation each.
2. Try finding the shortest subarray with a gcd equal to 1.
