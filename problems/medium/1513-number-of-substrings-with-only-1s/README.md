**Topics:** Math, String  
**Acceptance Rate:** 50.0%

## Problem Description

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of substrings with all characters `1`'s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "0110111"
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 substrings with only 1's characters.
"1" appears 5 times.
"11" appears 3 times.
"111" appears 1 time.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "1" appears 2 times.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "111111"
Output: 21
Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`
